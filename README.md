## Overview
This tool is designed to automate the process of committing changes to your codebase. It not only commits your staged changes but also generates a commit message for you. If there is an issue related to the commit, the tool will automatically add the issue number to the commit message.

The tool automatically commits changes made to the codebase. This eliminates the need for manual intervention, making the process more efficient and less prone to errors.

## Features

### Commit Message Generation
The tool generates a commit message for each commit. This feature is designed to provide meaningful context for each commit without the need for manual input.

### Issue Number Addition
If there is an issue related to the commit, the tool will automatically add the issue number to the commit message. This helps in tracking the progress of issues and linking commits to specific issues.

## Demo
